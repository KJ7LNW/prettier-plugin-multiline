- tests for src/path/foo.ts must be in src/path/__tests__/testname.spec.ts using vitest
- when working with a test that is having trouble always use `npx vitest run <test> -t "name sub string"` to maintain focus 
- printWidth: this value must remain undefined or default

- if you have been instructed to create a test, that test must not be skipped
- never restate logs or command output, I can see them and so can you
- never show me source code that exists in files unless it is a 5 line sample
- I am not reading what you have to say so whatever you say is only for yourself be terse and concise focus on the fixes not the discussion 
- every 10 responses you must summarize:
	- all of the intended goals for this entire discussion 
	- use symbols to indicate which are complete and which are pending
	- summarize what worked and what did not 
	- display a series of tasks of what you will attempt next to complete the next goal
